Unevenly Spaced Time Series: Moving Averages and Other Rolling Operators
This repository started as a conversion of the code from this [one](https://github.com/andreas50/utsAlgorithms).
Right now the library contains more algorithms that help while dealing with Unevenly Spaced Time Series, for more details check the [here](#documentation).

## Running unit tests

Several unit tests were written to validate some corner cases.
The unit tests were written in [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).
Run the following commands to execute the unit tests.

```bash
python -m unittest
```
